## Node Editor
Almost every node editor made in unity is using unity editor to make it.  
My goal was make it in runtime with unity ui.

Progress so far:
```
[x] Add and delete nodes
[x] Drag and drop connection
[x] Graph context menu
[x] Graph zoom and pan
[x] Node context menu
[ ] Save graph as json
[ ] Load graph
[ ] Blackboard 
[x] Implement single/multiple socket 
```

Current state is quite experimental.  
Feel free to drop an issue for any suggestion or feedback.
